HaskellHomework
===============
Functional is great! well, mostly

squareCond [11,12,13]   -----> exception: <<loop>>  loop

re- Ch1Lists.hs  line 56-64

re-    ch3Types.hs

[["1","2","3"],["a","b","c"]] :: [[[Char]]]   this was confusing at first, each"_" is a String, ie, a list of characters
so there is one list that contains two lists that contains 3 lists of character, each of those 3 lists is a singleton list of characters

resume line 22   ch3Types.hs
